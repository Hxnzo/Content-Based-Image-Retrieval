# DataStructuresFinalProject

#### Developed a Python program that allows users to compare black-and-white images using angled projections. The user can select an image and then run the algorithm to find another image that is the most similar to it using hamming distances, achieving a 70% success rate. By optimizing key parameters and refining preprocessing techniques, I improved the image comparison algorithm, resulting in faster retrieval times and enhanced accuracy.
